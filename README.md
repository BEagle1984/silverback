Silverback is a **powerful, elegant, and feature-rich message bus for .NET**, designed to simplify asynchronous messaging, event-driven architectures, and microservice communication. With seamless integration for **Apache Kafka** and **MQTT**, it offers robust features for **reliability, consistency, and scalability**.

Whether you're building a **small microservice, a large-scale enterprise solution, or anything in between**, Silverback provides the tools to make messaging effortless and reliable.

## Why Choose Silverback?

Silverback is designed for **serious workloads**, offering enterprise-grade capabilities with a rich feature set optimized for **performance, resilience, and scalability**.

### Key Features

üîÄ **Powerful Message Bus**\
A simple but powerful in-memory message bus enables seamless communication between components, featuring **Rx.NET** support for reactive programming.

üîó **Seamless Message Broker Integration**\
Silverback makes it easy to integrate with Kafka and MQTT, providing a streamlined and developer-friendly API to build event-driven architectures with minimal setup and configuration.

üöÄ **Kafka-Optimized Messaging**\
Unlike generic messaging libraries, Silverback is built specifically for Kafka, leveraging its unique capabilities for high-throughput, exactly-once semantics, and partitioned processing. While Silverback also supports MQTT, Kafka is a first-class citizen, and the framework is highly optimized to take full advantage of its power.

üì§ **Transactional Outbox**\
Ensures message consistency by linking database transactions with messaging, preventing message loss and guaranteeing atomicity.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced Error Handling**\
Define flexible strategies to **retry, skip, or move messages** based on custom policies, ensuring robustness in failure scenarios.

üì¶ **Batch Processing & Chunking**\
Enhances efficiency by processing messages in bulk or splitting large messages into smaller chunks, which are automatically reassembled on the receiving end.

‚ö° **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Support**\
Automates domain event publishing when entities are persisted, ensuring seamless integration with message brokers for event-driven workflows.

‚úÖ **Exactly-Once Processing**\
Ensures each message is consumed and processed exactly once, preventing duplicate processing and maintaining data integrity.

üîç **Distributed Tracing**\
Leverages **System.Diagnostics** for full visibility into message flow and distributed transaction tracking.

üß™ **Testability**\
Provides in-memory mocks for **Kafka** and **MQTT**, along with powerful helpers for efficient unit testing.

‚ú® **And much more!**\
Silverback is highly extensible, making it the go-to messaging framework for .NET developers who want to harness Kafka‚Äôs full potential while maintaining flexibility for other brokers.

# Setting Up Silverback

Silverback is designed as a modular framework, allowing you to include only the components you need. This guide walks you through selecting the right packages and configuring the basics to get started.
