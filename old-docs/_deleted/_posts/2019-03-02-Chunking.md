Added chunking to help dealing with large messages.

Have a look at the [Chunking documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/advanced/chunking) for more information.

Several bugs have been fixed along the way and it is therefore strongly advised to upgrade as soon as possible to the latest verion of the nuget packages.
