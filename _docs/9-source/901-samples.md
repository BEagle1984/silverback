A solution containing a few examples can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/tree/develop/samples/Examples).

It includes a sample consumer (`Silverback.Examples.ConsumerA`) and a sample producer (`Silverback.Examples.Main`) implementing several common use cases. Just run both console applications to see the samples in action.

## Environment

To execute the samples you need a running Apache Kafka (obviously) and SQL Server.

Use the [docker compose file](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/tree/develop/docker-compose.yaml) in the root of the repository to startup the environment.
