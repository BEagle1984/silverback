title:  First "beta" release
---

The first release of the Core and Integration packages have been uploaded to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Silverback).

Remember that we are still on an early stage and even though it can be considered fairly mature it is not yet battle-tested in a real productive environment. There's also no guarantee that no breaking changes will be introduced before the actual release 1.0.
