A solution containing a few examples can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/tree/develop/samples/Examples).

It includes a sample consumer (`Silverback.Examples.ConsumerA`) and a sample producer (`Silverback.Examples.Main`) implementing several common use cases. Just run both console applications to see the samples in action.

Of course you need a running Kafka instance for the samples to work. Follow the instructions in the following page to quickly setup a local Kafka cluster (requires Docker): [Kafka deployment on Docker]({{ site.baseurl }}docs/extra/kafka-docker).
