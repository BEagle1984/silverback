Silverback is basically two things:
* a message bus that can be used to decouple layers or components inside an application
* an abstraction over a message broker like Apache Kafka.

Combining those two fundamental pieces allows to build reactive and resilient microservices, using a very simple and familiar programming model.

The following diagram shows the Silverback's main components and how they interact in a typical use case.

\# | Description
-- | :--
1 | Some domain entities are modified
2 | When the entities are saved 1 or more events are published
3 | Some other services subscribe to such events and perform some extra work (that may lead to other events being published and so on)
4 | The outbound connector catches the messages to relay them to the message broker
5 | A producer is used to publish the messages to a Kafka topic
6 | The messages are published to Kafka
7 | Another microservices is consuming the topic and receives the messages
8 | The consumer forwards the messages to the inbound connector
9 | The messages are relayed to the internal message bus
10 | Some subscribers process the events
1b | As a result some entities are modifierd
2b | When the entities are saved 1 or more events are published
3b | The outbound connector catches the messages to relay them to the message broker
4b | A producer is used to publish the messages to a Kafka topic
5b | The messages are published to Kafka

## Packages

Silverback is modular and delivered in multiple packages, available through [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Silverback).

### Core

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Core.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core/)
**Silverback.Core**<br/>
It implements a very simple, yet very effective, publish/subscribe in-memory bus that can be used to decouple the software parts and easily implement a Domain Driven Design approach.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Core.Model.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core.Model/)
**Silverback.Core.Model**<br/>
It contains some interfaces that will help organize the messages and write cleaner code, adding some semantic. It also includes a sample implementation of a base class for your domain entities.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Core.EntityFrameworkCore.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core.EntityFrameworkCore/)
**Silverback.Core.EntityFrameworkCore**<br/>
It contains the storage implementation to integrate Silverback with Entity Framework Core. It is needed to use a `DbContext` as storage for (temporary) data and to fire the domain events as part of the `SaveChanges` transaction.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Core.Rx.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core.Rx/)
**Silverback.Core.Rx**<br/>
Adds the possibility to create an Rx `Observable` over the internal bus.

### Integration

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration/)
**Silverback.Integration**<br/>
Contains the message broker and connectors abstraction. Inbound and outbound connectors can be attached to a message broker to either export some events/commands/messages to other microservices or react to the messages fired by other microservices in the same way as internal messages are handled.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.Kafka.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration.Kafka/)
**Silverback.Integration.Kafka**<br/>
An implementation of `Silverback.Integration` for the popular Apache Kafka message broker. It internally uses the `Confluent.Kafka` client library.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.RabbitMQ.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration.RabbitMQ/)
**Silverback.Integration.Kafka**<br/>
An implementation of `Silverback.Integration` for the popular RabbitMQ message broker. It internally uses the `RabbitMQ.Client` library.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.InMemory.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration.InMemory/)
**Silverback.Integration.InMemory**<br/>
Includes a mocked message broker to be used for testing only.

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.Configuration.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration.Configuration/)
**Silverback.Integration.Configuration**<br/>
Contains the logic to read the broker endpoints configuration from the `IConfiguration` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` (appsettings.json, environment variables, etc.)

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.Integration.HealthChecks.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Integration.HealthChecks/)
**Silverback.Integration.HealthChecks**<br/>
Contains the extensions for `Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` to monitor the connection to the message broker.

### Event Sourcing

[![NuGet](http://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Silverback.EventSourcing.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.EventSourcing/)
**Silverback.EventSourcing**<br/>
Contains an implementation of an event store that perfectly integrates within the Silverback ecosystem.
