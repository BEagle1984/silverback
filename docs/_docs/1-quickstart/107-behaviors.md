The behaviors can be used to build a custom pipeline (similar to the asp.net pipeline), easily adding your cross-cutting functionalities such as logging, validation, etc.

## IBehavior

The behaviors implementing the `IBehavior` interface will be invoked by the `IPublisher` internals every time a message is published to the internal bus (this includes the wrapped `IInboundMessage` and `IOutboundMessages` that are generated to produce or consume a message from the message broker).

At every call to `IPublisher.Publish` the `Handle` method of each registered behavior is called, passing in the collection of messages and the delegate to the next step in the pipeline. This gives you the flexibility to execute any sort of code before and after the messages have been actually published (before or after calling the `next()` step). You can for example modify the messages before publishing them, validate them (like in the above example), add some logging / tracing, etc.

### IBehavior example

The following example demonstrates how to use a behavior to trace the messages.

```c#
using Silverback.Messaging.Publishing;

public class TracingBehavior : IBehavior
{
    private readonly ITracer _tracer;

    public TracingBehavior(ITracer tracer)
    {
        _tracer = tracer;
    }

    public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<object>> Handle(
        IReadOnlyCollection<object> messages, 
        MessagesHandler next)
    {
        tracer.TraceProcessing(messages);
        var result = await next(messages);
        tracer.TraceProcessed(messages);

        return result;
    }
}
```

**Note:** The `Handle` receives a collection of `object` because a bunch of messages can be published at once via `IPublisher` or the consumer can be configured to process the messages in batch.

**Note:** `IInboundMessage` and `IOutboundMessage` are internally used by Silverback to wrap the messages being sent to or received from the message broker and will be received by the `IBroker`. Those interfaces contains the message plus the additional data like endpoint, headers, offset, etc.
{: .notice--info}

The `IBehavior` implementation have simply to be registered for DI.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services
        .AddSilverback()
        .AddScopedBehavior<TracingBehavior>();
```

**Note:** All `Add*Behavior` methods are available also as extensions to the `IServiceCollection` and it isn't therefore mandatory to call them immediately after `AddSilverback`.
{: .notice--info}


## IProducerBehavior and IConsumerBehavior

The `IProducerBehavior` and `IConsumerBehavior` are similar to the `IBehavior` but work at a lower level, much closer to the message broker.

### IProducerBehavior example

The following example demonstrate how to set a custom message header on each outbound message.

```c#
public class CustomHeadersBehavior : IProducerBehavior
{
    public async Task Handle(RawBrokerMessage message, RawBrokerMessageHandler next)
    {
        message.Headers.Add("generated-by", "silverback");
    }
}
```

### IConsumerBehavior example

The following example demonstrate how to log the headers received with each inbound message.

```c#
public class LogHeadersBehavior :IConsumerBehavior
{
    private readonly ILogger<LogHeadersBehavior> _logger;

    public LogHeadersBehavior(ILogger<LogHeadersBehavior> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public async Task Handle(RawBrokerMessage message, RawBrokerMessageHandler next)
    {
        foreach (var header in message.Headers)
        {
            _logger.LogTrace(
                "{key}={value}",
                header.Key,
                header.Value);
        }

        return await next(messages);
    }
}
```

### Limitations

Because of the way the Silverback's broker integration works `IProducerBehavior` and `IConsumerBehavior` implementations can only be registered as singleton. If a scoped instance is needed you have to either reference the `IServiceProvider` or use an `IBehavior` (that can still be used to accomplish most of the tasks, as shown in the next example).

```c#
public class TracingBehavior : IBehavior
{
    private readonly IDbLogger _dbLogger;

    public TracingBehavior(IDbLogger _dbLogger)
    {
        _dbLogger = dbLogger;
    }

    public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<object>> Handle(
        IReadOnlyCollection<object> messages, 
        MessagesHandler next)
    {
        foreach (var message in messages.OfType<IInboundMessage>())
        {
            _dbLogger.LogInboundMessage(
                message.Content.GetType(), 
                message.Headers,
                message.Endpoint,
                message.Offset);
        }

        await _dbLogger.SaveChangesAsync();

        return await next(messages);
    }
}
```
