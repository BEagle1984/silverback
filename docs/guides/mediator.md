# Using the Mediator

The mediator is the central component of Silverback that allows you to publish messages and have them delivered to the appropriate subscribers.

## Creating the Message Model

First, we need to create a message class. The message class can be any POCO class. Any CLR type can be used or referenced since messages are only exchanged in memory, making it similar to calling a method directly.

```csharp
public class SampleMessage
{
    public string Content { get; set; }
}
```

It is not mandatory, but it is recommended to use the [Silverback.Core.Model](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core.Model) package (documented in the next chapter) to enhance semantics and improve code readability.

### Silverback.Core.Model

Dedicated interfaces for events, commands, and queries are available in [Silverback.Core.Model](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Core.Model) to help define the meaning of each message, making the code more structured and readable.

The *integration* variations are designed for messages exchanged via a message broker like Apache Kafka or MQTT.

These are the available interfaces:

- <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IEvent> is used to notify other services of an event that has occurred. Events are fire-and-forget messages, meaning no response is expected.
- <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.ICommand> and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.ICommand`1> are used to trigger actions in another service or component. Commands are typically consumed by a single subscriber and can return a value (of type `TResult`).
- <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IQuery`1> functions similarly to <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.ICommand`1> but always returns a result, as it represents a data request.
- The <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IIntegrationMessage> interface identifies messages exchanged through a message broker. It has two specialized variations: <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IIntegrationEvent> and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IIntegrationCommand>.

## Publishing Messages

To publish a message, you need an instance of <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher>, which can be injected via dependency injection.

```csharp
using Silverback.Messaging.Publishing;

public class MyPublishingService
{
    private readonly IPublisher _publisher;

    public MyPublishingService(IPublisher publisher)
    {
        _publisher = publisher;
    }

    public async Task PublishSomething()
    {
        SampleMessage message = new SampleMessage
        {
            Content = "Silverback rocks!"
        };
        await _publisher.PublishAsync(message);
    }
}
```

The publisher provides both synchronous and asynchronous versions of each method.

### Return Values

Subscribers can return a result after processing a message.

```csharp
public async Task<QueryResult> PublishSomething()
{
    MyQuery query = new MyQuery() { ... };
    QueryResult result = await _publisher.PublishAsync(query);
    return result.Single();
}
```

> [!Note]
> The call to `Single()` is required because Silverback allows multiple subscribers for the same message, collecting multiple return values. This is unnecessary when using the specialized publishers described in the next chapter. The `ICommand` and `IQuery` interfaces specify the `TResult` type for better clarity.

### Specialized Publisher Extensions

Each message type (<xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IEvent>, <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.ICommand>/<xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.ICommand`1>, and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.IQuery`1>) includes specialized extensions for <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher> to improve semantics and clarity.

```csharp
public async Task PublishEvent()
{
    MyEvent myEvent = new MyEvent() { ... };
    await _publisher.PublishEventAsync(myEvent);
}

public async Task ExecuteCommand()
{
    MyCommand myCommand = new MyCommand() { ... };
    await _publisher.ExecuteCommandAsync(myCommand);
}
```

## Subscribing to Messages

Now, we need to write a subscriber method to process the published messages.

Silverbackâ€™s internal bus routes messages based on their type. When a message is published, Silverback evaluates the signatures of subscribed methods and invokes those accepting the specific message type, a base type, or an implemented interface.

### Subscriber Class

The preferred way to subscribe is by implementing message handling logic in a dedicated subscriber class.

```csharp
public class SubscribingService
{
    public async Task OnMessageReceived(SampleMessage message)
    {
        // Process message
    }
}
```

The subscriber class must be registered with the DI container using the `AddScopedSubscriber`, `AddSingletonSubscriber`, or `AddTransientSubscriber` extension methods.

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services
            .AddSilverback()
            .AddScopedSubscriber<SubscribingService>();
    }
}
```

By default, all public methods in a registered subscriber class are subscribed. To subscribe non-public methods or customize subscription options, use <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.SubscribeAttribute>.

You can also disable automatic subscription of public methods:

```csharp
services
    .AddSilverback()
    .AddScopedSubscriber<SubscribingService>(autoSubscribeAllPublicMethods: false);
```

## Cancellation

If a subscriber method accepts a `CancellationToken`, Silverback will forward the optional cancellation token to the subscribers.

```csharp
await _publisher.ExecuteCommandAsync(myCommand, cancellationToken);
```

The cancellation token can be used to interrupt long-running operations or can be passed to other API such as HTTP requests or database operations supporting cancellation.

```csharp
public async Task OnCommandReceived(MyCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    while (...) // Long-running operation
    {
        cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
        
        // Processing
    }
}
```

## Behaviors

Behaviors allow you to implement a custom pipeline (similar to ASP.NET middleware), adding cross-cutting concerns like logging and validation.

```csharp
public class TracingBehavior : IBehavior
{
    private readonly ITracer _tracer;

    public TracingBehavior(ITracer tracer)
    {
        _tracer = tracer;
    }
    
    public async Task<IReadOnlyCollection<object?>> HandleAsync(
        object message,
        MessageHandler next)
    {
        try
        {
            _tracer.TraceProcessing(message);
            object result = await next(message);
            _tracer.TraceProcessed(message);
            return result;
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _tracer.TraceError(message, ex);
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

Register the behavior with the DI container using `AddScopedBehavior`, `AddSingletonBehavior`, or `AddTransientBehavior`.

```csharp
services
    .AddSilverback()
    .AddScopedBehavior<TracingBehavior>();
```

If execution order is important, implement <xref:Silverback.ISorted> and specify `SortIndex`.

```csharp
public class SortedBehavior : IBehavior, ISorted
{
    public int SortIndex => 120;
    
    public Task<IReadOnlyCollection<object?>> HandleAsync(
        object message,
        MessageHandler next)
    {
        return next(message);
    }
}
```
