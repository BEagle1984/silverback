# Release Notes v0.x.x

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/releases/tag/v0.10.0)

### What's New

* Improve error handling: now all exceptions, including the ones thrown by the message serialzer can be handled through the error policies
* Improve logs: promoted some important logs to Information level, writing all processing errors as (at least) Warning and improved logged information quality (logged attributes)
* Add ability to modify messages and headers when moving them via `MoveMessageErrorPolicy`
* Refactor message processing to a cleaner, more extensible and predictable API and behavior

### Fixes

* Fixed several small (and not so small) issues and bugs

## 0.8.0 - 0.9.0

Released two versions mostly to fix bugs, do some small adjustments according to some user feedbacks and update the external dependencies (e.g. Confluent.Kafka 1.0.1).

### Fixes

* Fix exception loading error policies from JSON in Silverback.Integration.Configuration [[#24](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/issues/24)]

## 0.7.0

### What's New

* Upgrade to [Confluent.Kafka 1.0.0](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
* Create a simple event store that perfectly integrates with the rest of the Silverback framework
* Add Silverback.Integration.InMemory package to mock the message broker behavior in your unit tests
* Several small optimizations and improvements

## 0.6.0

### What's New

* Add support for message headers
* Simplify message subscription even further: now all public methods of the types implementing the marker interface _ISubscriber_ are automatically subscribed by default without having to annotate them with the <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.SubscribeAttribute> (this behavior is customizable)
* Upgrade to [Confluent.Kafka 1.0.0-RC1](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/releases/tag/v1.0-RC1)

## 0.3.x - 0.5.x

Some releases where done adding quite a few features.

### What's New

* Add Silverback.Integration.Configuration package to load the inbound/outbound configuration from the app.settings json
* Add batch processing
* Add parallel subscribers
* Add delegate subscription as an alternative to <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.SubscribeAttribute> based subscription
* Improve support for Rx.net
* Add support for legacy messages and POCO classes
* Add offset storage as an alternative and more optimized way to guarantee exactly once processing, storing just the offset of the last message instead of logging every message (see <xref:kafka-offset>)
* Add behaviors as a convenient way to implement your cross-cutting concerns (like logging, validation, etc.) to be plugged into the internal bus publishing pipeline (see <xref:mediator>)
* Add message chunking to automatically split the larger messages and rebuild them on the other end (see <xref:chunking>)
* ...much more...and a huge amount of refactorings

### Fixes

* Several fixes and optimizations

## 0.3.2

The very first public release of Silverback! It included:

* In-process message bus
* Inbound/outbound connector for message broker abstraction
* Kafka broker implementation
* Outbox table pattern implementation
* Exactly once processing
* ...
