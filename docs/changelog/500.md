# Release Notes v5.x.x

## [5.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/BEagle1984/silverback/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.1)

Silverback 5.0.0 is the most significant update in the library’s history, built on years of user feedback and real-world experience. This release is more than just an upgrade—it’s a **complete refactoring** that enhances flexibility, performance, and maintainability while laying a strong foundation for future innovations.

### What's New

* Clean up code and increase tests coverage
* Reduce allocations and improve performance in many places (see <xref:performance>)
* Register <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher> as transient instead of scoped to allow injecting it into singleton services
* Add `CancellationToken` support to the mediator <xref:mediator>
* Improve builders for error policies
* Support subscribers returning `ValueTask`
* Support exponential delay in `RetryErrorPolicy`
* Add new `AddHeader`, `WithMessageId` and `WithKafkaKey` overloads in `ProducerEndpointConfigurationBuilder` for easier and more readable configuration
* Introduce typed endpoints registration using `Consume<TMessage>` and `Produce<TMessage>` methods (replacing `AddInbound` and `AddOutbound`), making the nested configuration more readable and type-safe. (see <xref:producing> and <xref:consuming>)
* Automatically set the typed deserializer according to the message type when using `Consume<TMessage>` to configure the endpoint (see <xref:deserialization>)
* Automatically set the typed <xref:Silverback.Messaging.BinaryMessages.BinaryMessageDeserializer`1> according to the message type when using `Consume<TMessage>` to configure the endpoint (see <xref:deserialization>)
* Add full fluent API for Kafka and MQTT configuration (see <xref:producing> and <xref:consuming>)
* Rewrite storage implementation from scratch and introduce new [Silverback.Storage.PostgreSql](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Storage.PostgreSql/), [Silverback.Storage.Sqlite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Storage.Sqlite/), [Silverback.Storage.EntityFramework](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Storage.EntityFramework/) and [Silverback.Storage.Memory](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silverback.Storage.Memory/) packages, see <xref:storage>
* Refactor transactional outbox adding support for transaction enlistment (even if not using Entity Framework) and improving performance (see <xref:outbox>)
* Improve outbox worker reliability
* Add message filtering in producer configuration (see <xref:producing>)
* Improve and simplify tombstone handling (see <xref:producing-tombstone> and <xref:consuming-tombstone>)
* Add `IInboundEnvelope` extensions to get broker specific metadata such as `GetKafkaOffset()`, `GetKafkaTimestamp()`, `GetMqttResponseTopic()` and `GetMqttCorrelationData()`
* Add `IOutboundEnvelope` extensions to set broker specific metadata such as `SetKafkaKey()`, `SetMqttResponseTopic()` and `SetMqttCorrelationData()`
* Add `WrapAndProduce` and `WrapAndProduceAsync` methods to <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher> to allow envelope enrichment (setting headers, kafka key, etc.) and dynamic routing (see <xref:producing>)
* Add `WrapAndProduceBatch` and `WrapAndProduceBatchAsync` methods to <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher> (see <xref:producing>) with the same capabilities of `WrapAndProduce` and `WrapAndProduceAsync`, supporting streaming, mapping and efficient batching with Kafka (see <xref:producing>)
* Refactor and improve <xref:Silverback.Domain.EntityFrameworkDomainEventsPublisher`1>
* Improve `ITestingHelper` to allow waiting for specific topics to be consumed (see <xref:testing>)
* Add <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.InboundEnvelopeBuilder`1> and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Messages.OutboundEnvelopeBuilder`1> to testing packages to help creating test envelopes (see <xref:testing>)
* Support Kafka cooperative sticky partition assignment strategy
* Implement transactional client-side offset storage (see <xref:kafka-offset>)
* Support Kafka transactions (see <xref:kafka-transactions>)
* Add support for Confluent schema registry (Avro, Json and Protobuf), including mock for in-memory testing
* Add `IgnoreNoMatchingSubscribersError` setting to MQTT producer endpoints, to prevent throwing when no subscriber is consuming the produced message
* Basic support for MQTT 5 request-response
* Add <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.ConsumerNameFilterAttribute> to filter the subscribers by consumer name (replaces <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.KafkaGroupIdFilterAttribute> and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Subscribers.MqttClientIdFilterAttribute>)
* Upgrade to [Confluent.Kafka 2.8.0](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet/releases/tag/v2.2.0)
* Upgrade to [MQTTnet 5.0.1.1416](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet/releases/tag/v5.0.1.1416)

### Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes, as the library underwent a significant refactoring. The following list might be incomplete but should give you an overview of the most important changes:

* `IEventPublisher`, `ICommandPublisher` and `IQueryPublisher` replaced by extension methods on <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Publishing.IPublisher>
* Refactored the configuration model and related fluent API, refer to the updated [Guides](xref:setup) and [Samples](xref:samples) to see how it looks like in the new version
  * Many types, properties and methods have been renamed or modified to improve readability, consistency, and ergonomics
  * Reorganized the configuration namespaces, some extension methods might have been moved to a different namespace, thus requiring a different `using`.
  * Changed the endpoint models and most of the configuration models to [records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record) with init-only properties
  * Building the endpoints directly is still supported but the strongly recommended preferred way is to use the fluent API, therefore from now on the documentation will only show that approach
  * Removed all builders interfaces and exposed the actual classes directly (e.g. `ISilverbackBuilder` to `SilverbackBuilder`)
  * `AddOutbound`/`AddInbound` methods have been replaced by `AddKafkaClients`/`AddMqttClients` and `Produce`/`Consume` methods
  * `BatchSettings`, `ChunkSettings`, `SequenceSettings`, ` EncryptionSettings`, etc. renamed to `BatchConfiguration`, `ChunkConfiguration`, `SequenceConfiguration`, ` EncryptionConfiguration`, etc.
  * `Configure` method for Kafka clients replaced by configuration methods such as `WithBootstrapServers`, `WithGroupId`, `WithClientId`, etc.
  * `IBrokerCallback` and `Add*BrokerCallbackHandler` methods renamed to `IBrokerClientCallback` and `Add*BrokerClientCallback`
  * ... (many more changes)
* Split the `IMessageSerializer` interface into <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Serialization.IMessageSerializer> and <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Serialization.IMessageDeserializer>
* Outbox and all storage dependent features have been rewritten from scratch, look at the [Guides](xref:setup) for more details about the new implementation
* Exactly once guard has been replaced by the client side offset storage, see <xref:kafka-offset>
Publishing.IPublisher> itself and removed the `UseModel` configuration method (see <xref:mediator>)
* Removed the whole `IBroker` and `IBrokerCollection` constructs
  * They are superseded by the `IProducerCollection` and `IConsumerCollection` interfaces, as well as the `IBrokerClientCollection` which grants access to all underlying broker clients
* Changed some details in <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Broker.IProducer>/<xref:Silverback.Messaging.Broker.IConsumer> and their implementations
* A lot of methods have been changed to return a `ValueTask` instead of a `Task`
* Kafka key won't be set to a random `Guid` anymore but will be `null` if not explicitly set
* Some changes to default settings:
  * Increased default [KafkaConsumerConfiguration.MaxDegreeOfParallelism](xref:Silverback.Messaging.Configuration.Kafka.KafkaConsumerConfiguration#Silverback_Messaging_Configuration_Kafka_KafkaConsumerConfiguration_MaxDegreeOfParallelism) to 100
  * Increased default [KafkaConsumerConfiguration.BackpressureLimit](xref:Silverback.Messaging.Configuration.Kafka.KafkaConsumerConfiguration#Silverback_Messaging_Configuration_Kafka_KafkaConsumerConfiguration_BackpressureLimit) to 50
  * Changed default <xref:Silverback.Messaging.Serialization.NewtonsoftJsonMessageDeserializer`1> typename handling to `TypeNameHandling.None` to lay on the safe side
* Several changes have been made to <xref:Silverback.Testing.ITestingHelper>, <xref:Silverback.Testing.IKafkaTestingHelper>, and <xref:Silverback.Testing.IMqttTestingHelper>
* Removed the `AddSubscribers` methods allowing to register subscribers via a base type or interface
* ... (many more changes)

### Migration Guide

The migration from Silverback 4.x.x to 5.x.x is a significant step and requires some effort. The following list should give you an overview of the most important steps:
