# How to contribute

Please read these guidelines before contributing to Silverback:

* [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
* [Feature Requests](#feature)
* [Submitting a Pull Request](#pullrequest)
* [Contributor License Agreement](#cla)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help by submitting an issue to
the [GitHub repository][github]. Or, even better, you can submit a [pull request](#pullrequest) with a fix.

When submitting an issue please include the following information:

* A description of the issue
* The exception message and stacktrace if an error was thrown
* If possible, please include code that reproduces the issue. [DropBox][dropbox] or GitHub's [Gist][gist] can be used to share large code
  samples, or you could [submit a pull request](#pullrequest) with the issue reproduced in a new unit test.

The more information you include about the issue, the more likely it is to be fixed!

## <a name="feature"></a> Want a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to the [GitHub repository][github]. Before requesting a feature consider the following:

* Silverback has many extensibility points, it is very likely that you can implement your feature without having to modify Silverback
* Stability is important and large breaking changes are unlikely to be accepted

## <a name="pullrequest"></a> Submitting a Pull Request

When submitting a pull request to the [GitHub repository][github] make sure to do the following:

* Check that new and updated code follows Silverback's existing code formatting and naming standard
* Run all unit tests to ensure no existing functionality has been affected
* Write new unit tests to test your changes: all features and fixed bugs must have tests to verify they work
* Run a code cleanup on the files you touched if using R# or Rider

Read [GitHub help][pullrequesthelp] for more details about creating pull requests.

Detailed step-by-step instructions to build and test Silverback can be found in the [project's website][build-docs].
